# Java Application

This is a small personal project intended for my own exploration and familiarity with Java and its functionalities.  

The application facilitates the creation and logging of tasks, storing the logged tasks in a JSON file. Each logged task includes the current date and time, maintaining a history of logs within the JSON file.
